          My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there,
          and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there.
          Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna
          tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherf***er.

          Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense!
          In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the
          exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me!
          I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids.
          They called me Mr Glass.

          The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the
          selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
          and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is
          truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike
          down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt
          to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when
          I lay My vengeance upon thee.

          Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised
          as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that
          in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime.
          Like they're actually proud of that shit.
